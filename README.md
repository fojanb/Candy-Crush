# Candy-Crush
I implemented Candy-Crush LOGIC (not the design) via JavaScript :)
BTW I only implemented cross moves , I leave rest of the moves to you. It is easy.
I have focused on the logic not the design.
*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
What JavaScript inbuilt methods did I used ?
- Whole bunch of addEventListener for drag and drop moves.
- Arrays inbuilt methods such as:
    - includes()
    - forEach()
    - every()
- setAttribute()
- DOMContentLoaded
- appendChild()
- classList.add()
- window.setInterval()
